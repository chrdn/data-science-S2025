*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

``` r
df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Class (Character: “1st”, “2nd”, “3rd”, “Crew”
- Sex: (Character: “Male”, “Female”)
- Age: (Character: “Child”, “Adult”)
- Survived (Character: “yes” or “no)
- n (Double: number of people under a given group)

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - 2224 - 2201 = 23
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - This is a small difference.
  - We can only estimate because there are discrepancies between the
    original passenger and crew lists. Some factors that lead to this
    are misspellings, omissions, aliases, and failure to count
    contracted employees (such as musicians) as crew or passengers. Most
    estimates are based on the total capacity of the ship being around
    2200.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
titanic_survivors <- 
  df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes")
titanic_survivors
```

    ## # A tibble: 16 × 5
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child Yes          5
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child Yes         11
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child Yes         13
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child Yes          0
    ##  5 1st   Female Child Yes          1
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child Yes         13
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child Yes         14
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child Yes          0
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult Yes         57
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult Yes         14
    ## 11 3rd   Male   Adult Yes         75
    ## 12 Crew  Male   Adult Yes        192
    ## 13 1st   Female Adult Yes        140
    ## 14 2nd   Female Adult Yes         80
    ## 15 3rd   Female Adult Yes         76
    ## 16 Crew  Female Adult Yes         20

``` r
titanic_survivors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y=n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
```

**Observations**:

- Generally, more female passengers survived. Most of the crew was
  probably male, which meant that more male crew survived.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # ℹ 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
prop_titanic_survivors <- 
  df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes")
prop_titanic_survivors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y=Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

**Observations**:

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

v1 (pre revision)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

- Write your observations here.
  - Generally, a bigger percentage of female occupants survived
    (compared to the overall female passenger population at that class)
    than male occupants of the same class.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - Although this plot shows percentages, the percentage itself is a bit
    unclear. It can be a percentage of the entire ship (which it is not)
    or a percentage of the same “type” of occupant. Although this shows
    the “likelihood” of a occupants surviving given their Class, Sex,
    and Age, it does not properly convey the proportion to the entire
    population.
  - This is evident by the high number of female crew survivors, despite
    more male crew survivors in the raw data.
  - Also, these proportions have not been adjusted to *percentages* that
    means that we are getting $>100\%$ percentages because the age
    groups are added together. If we summed `Prop`, we would get a
    $\sim 900\%$ survival rate. Thus, this chart is not useful and is
    prone to misunderstandings.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

v2 (post revision)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

- Write your observations here.
  - It looks like all first class and all second class passengers
    survived.
  - Crew male had the lowest proportion of survivors, closely followed
    by 3rd class male.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - There is no way that all first class and all second class passengers
    survived. If we look at the data, 57/175 first class males survive.
    Yet, the graph states otherwise.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
prop_titanic_survivors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y=Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Age))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

v1 (pre revision)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

- This graph shows the true percentage of survivors compared to the
  total population of the Titanic occupants. We also separate the groups
  into adult and child for added clarity. If we added the percentages
  together, we would get $\sim32\%$, which is about the real survivor
  percentage.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - In this graph, we were able to reach more believable proportion
    values. We also fixed the male-female crew survivor proportion.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

v2 (post revision)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

- This graph reveals the fishiness behind the plot generated in `q4`. It
  appears that the children “masked” the adults.

- In this graph, we can see that most of the females for the first and
  second class survived.

- All first and second class children survived.

- The population with the lowest survival rates was actually second
  class males.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
